- 👋 Hi, I’m @andy-iskauskas
- 👀 I’m interested in emulation and history matching, particularly Bayes Linear emulation; e-assessment development; and coding in general in R and Javascript
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the difficulties of making an R package that accommodates the use-cases of 100s of people!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything stats-y; in particular, the application of emulation to complex mathematical models.
- 📫 How to reach me: for *hmer* related things, raise an issue or pull request in the repo; otherwise, andrew.iskauskas@durham.ac.uk
